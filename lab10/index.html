	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<div class="animation"><p>The problems I was facing was to come up with some new style and understanding what suits best for the h1's and h2's. I was trying to understand how much does a heading text matters and how it draws attention to the website. I was searching for the best text that can look easy to read and will draw attention. I also learned how to use text-transform and letter spacing feature. </p>

<div class="inthebox">
<h2>Results</h2>
	<div class="animation"><p>I created a webpage that will draw attention if developed more. I also made the font easy to read and something which does not look boring. I also learned the display gradient and how to use it to make the webpage look more premium.</p>
