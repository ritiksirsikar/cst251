		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<div class="animation"><p>When I was using ordered list the index of the list were displaying on the left side. To solve that I tried many things but could not solve it and then I searched it on the internet and then I saw an attribute called list-style-position: inside; and after using that property I was able to display my index next to the list.</p>

	<div class="inthebox">
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<div class="animation"><p>I created a web page just like I wanted to. I styled the margins and padding of my content div and added a border, changed the color of my body and content div, styled my image by giving it the hover function so it increases it's size by 10% if you hover over it.</p>
